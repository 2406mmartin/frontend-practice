To join the Novamon Minecraft server, you'll need a few essential mods. Here's a step-by-step guide to getting everything set up.

## Step 1: Install Fabric Loader

You'll need **Fabric Loader** to run the mods. Here's how to get it:

1. Go to the [Fabric installer page](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) and download the installer.
2. If you're on Windows, select **Download for Windows** and open the file once it’s downloaded. Make sure **Minecraft** and **Minecraft Launcher** are closed.
3. In the installer, select the Minecraft version **1.20.1**.
4. Ensure that the **Create profile** box is checked, and then click **Install**.
